# Dissecting public opinion about Imran Khan using news articles

General elections are scheduled to be held in Pakistan in July and with political hype at an all high, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at what people have been saying about some of the most famous political personalities in Pakistan. I also wanted to evaluate what events, political or not, changed the general opinion of the average person.

Facebook's Data Science team did an interesting analysis of the emotional highs and lows of the NFL Season (https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/the-emotional-highs-and-lows-of-the-nfl-season/10152033221418859/), calculating the ratio of positive to negative words. They anonymously tagged millions of status updates over the course of the season pertaining to specific NFL teams and then counted the number of positive and negative emotion words (from a predefined list) in each post and used it to analyze the effect on the overall sentiment when their team won, as well as when their team lost.

This gave us an idea how to analyze the general sentiment about a politician/political party and find out the events that had the biggest effect on it.

## Goal

'Applying sentimental analysis on comments, tweets, Facebook, and forum posts to evaluate the general opinion about a political personality.'

Given the steady rise in popularity of Imran Khan since he revived PTI in 2011 (https://tribune.com.pk/story/310719/on-schedule-imran-khan-arrives-with-promise-of-historic-rally/) and entered politics as a serious contender, I decided to analyze the people's views about him and how they have changed over the past few years.

The exploratory and sentimental analysis done in this project, as a part of my internship at MarketLytics - a digital analytics consultancy, is done using R and takes a look at the public opinion around Imran Khan, a Pakistani politician and former cricketer who became the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, using 850 articles about Imran Khan from Dawn, Pakistan's oldest, leading and most widely read English-language newspaper. The public opinion is analyzed using the comments on the articles.
